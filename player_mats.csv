This is my duty, my burden, my privilege. It was I who counseled them to collapse the mouth of the cave, to entomb us here. It was I who taught the mages to wield the sister-words. Where so many have slipped beneath the shadow, I have remained in light.#Many say we are lost, that Gravehold is just that: our grave.

This is why we take the youngling mages there, to decant their minds, to clear their thoughts, even if only for that single pilgrimage. But I believe our true salvation lies beneath the city.

And so it does, in spite of our trials, our great adversity. The people in the market, they still find it within themselves to sit at their stall and hope for a good day's profit.

I still remember plucking one of those dlicate lights from the nothing, unaware I had snuffed out an entire world.#In time our cadre of orphans grew in number and in strangeness. We lost many companions along the way, each erased like that tiny light in the spiral. Their faith gave me the strength to journey forward, though in my heart it was retribution that urged me on.#There was a day when the spiral seemed to fall away and a sudden cold was upon us.

In real he was always around, practicing breach magic with my father, helping me with my own studies. I once asked Xaxos about the story, about how it actually went. He just knelt beside me and pointed at where my father was practicing, working the many facets of a shimmering stone. ""We retrieved that fallen star, Sahala. That is what is important. Power is often hidden in the cruelest of places. But that does not mean we have to be cruel to find it"". When Xaxos turned on the other mages, it broke my father's heart. He couldn't bring himself to choose between duty and love. So he chose neither and stepped down from his duties as a breach mage. I took the opposite path.

My new friend Reth, she's incredible--reminds me of Inco, kind of. The same kind of prickly--she said that the real danger in the woods is New Gravehold itself because it's so big and cleared out so many trees that it's attracting all kinds of Nameless (well, she calls 'em Portalborn) who normally would have just wandered around harmlessly. I'd always thought Inco was just misremembering his childhood when he said he was raised by a nice Nameless. But I guess there's all kinds of stuff on the surface I'd never have imagined.

Brama, at least, ought to know better. She should remember, as I do, that the arguing of the conclaves of sisters nearly tore our families apart: half of us desiring to remain in our surface home and abide the Nameless as we always have, the others seeking to flee underground and forge stronger defenses that would keep us safe.

This is my duty, my burden, my privilege. It was I who counseled them to collapse the mouth of the cave, to entomb us here. It was I who taught the mages to wield the sister-words. Where so many have slipped beneath the shadow, I have remained in light.#Many say we are lost, that Gravehold is just that: our grave.

Woe fills the air like dust, a patina of dread scattered upon everything. But in the deep, ah, in the deep there is peace.

This is why we take the youngling mages there, to decant their minds, to clear their thoughts, even if only for that single pilgrimage. But I believe our true salvation lies beneath the city.

Theirs is a power to cull wounds, to tear wide the membrane of the universe, to traverse the very emptiness that lay between.

The tools they wield are just that - tools. Who is to say we cannot use a tool for a better end?#Yet these words alone are enough to brand a mage heretic.

I simply do this because it was asked of me. I fight not truly for Gravehold alone, but selfishly - I would risk everything for the hope of leaving this place.

And so it does, in spite of our trials, our great adversity. The people in the market, they still find it within themselves to sit at their stall and hope for a good day's profit.

It had to be this one, for the path, and this place was the only place where one of these beasts had ever been seen. I lay in wait a long time.

I still remember plucking one of those dlicate lights from the nothing, unaware I had snuffed out an entire world.#In time our cadre of orphans grew in number and in strangeness. We lost many companions along the way, each erased like that tiny light in the spiral. Their faith gave me the strength to journey forward, though in my heart it was retribution that urged me on.#There was a day when the spiral seemed to fall away and a sudden cold was upon us.

In real he was always around, practicing breach magic with my father, helping me with my own studies. I once asked Xaxos about the story, about how it actually went. He just knelt beside me and pointed at where my father was practicing, working the many facets of a shimmering stone. ""We retrieved that fallen star, Sahala. That is what is important. Power is often hidden in the cruelest of places. But that does not mean we have to be cruel to find it"". When Xaxos turned on the other mages, it broke my father's heart.

There were flaws. Not the least of which was my own personal involvement. Power corrupts, it is often said. It is said less often that the corruption is not merely to the spirit, but also to the mind. Once I started down my path of discovery, I found myself more and more unwilling to stop. I eschewed safety protocols I had always held in the highest regard. I sacrificed my friend Karak to my ambitions, thinking my process ready for human trials. I listened to Karak screaming in the Void as the ritual aged him, melted his flesh, turned him into something grotesque and inhuman. But I would not stop. I hesitate to blame it all on the corrupting nature of Void essence, because that would excuse the greed and ambition that have always been embedded deep in me. I should not be excused. If this odd rebirth is a potential for a second chance, I do not intend to squander it. My mind is clearer than it has been in years. I already lost so much, my home, my friends, even my humanity. I do not intend to lose more.",Outcasts

I didn't even see the piece of rubble when it came down. I blacked out for a lot of it. Luckily. I assume my family thought I died. I try not to hold it against them. You see your little girl half crushed beneath a building you don't assume she'll bounce back from that. I'm still not entirely sure how I did. I hadn't had any training in breach magic. I hadn't picked out a special rock or learned the sister-words or whatever initiates do. The mages keep it all very wrapped up in their world. Normal people like my family were never informed about these things. All I know is I woke up buried alive, needing a way out, and then the rocks responded to me. I don't question how it happened. I just know it saved my life. I made myself legs out of the stones that I thought would be my tomb, and I walked all on my own. There was no one left in the ruins of Gravehold by then. I've been surviving for years down here alone. It's not the best life, but I'm surviving. I've got my legs. I've got my strength. Let the world come crashing down again: I made it through once, I can do it again.",Return to Gravehold

And when I say fate, I mean Ulgimor. Back in the day, before this fragment of the Umbra Titan stitched itself to my shadow, people called me a coward. I even called myself a coward. You can't fault me for being honest about it. I didn't have big plans for my life. Never aspired to be much more than what I was. A simple dirt merchant. I figured getting bound to Ulgimor would be the worst thing that would ever happen to me, but that was before the entire city was destroyed. Now I'm glad he was there, he pulled us both through that, sheltering me from the falling debris and keeping me moving. It's funny, you don't really get to know the horrifying shadow monster attached to your soul until you're stuck underground with it alone for decades. Then it becomes almost comforting. The last vestige of who you once were. But I like who I am now, who we are. Together. We're stronger when we cooperate. Only took being on my own to realize that.",Return to Gravehold

One is trained to command large quantities of aether for powerful offensives, and the other is trained to focus that energy, channel it, and keep it until control. Source and sink. My Tether's name was Phy. He used to call me his tide. ""You're boring, Lucien"", he would say. ""But you always get where you're going"". I lost Phy to a Portalborn a few months ago. I wasn't there. I should have been there. What am I without him? All finesse and nothing behind it. A tide with no waves, no force of ocean driving it forward.

Who needs to channel aether when you can simply tear open a conduit and let the power overwhelm you? The teachers says I'm reckless. I say I get results. I used to have a Tether, way back when. If I focus really hard, I can even remember his face. Green hair. Pale eyes. He had a weird penchant for plants and a tendency to wander off into the woods for hours at a time. One day he wandered off and simply didn't come back. We hadn't even had our tattoos done yet. What was I supposed to do? A single mage abandoned by her Tether and left to create my own kind of magic. So I did. A magic more powerful because I didn't have some partner holding me back. I don't need guidelines, I don't need a Tether, and I definitely don't need anyone's help.",Southern Village

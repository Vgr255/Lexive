Either way, the enchantment held and the heart of fire which is bound to his armor didn't even flicker when submerged completely. We found all kinds of treasures down there--it seems there's more to discover every time I delve--as well as a few surviving mages living in the air pockets of the tunnels, fending off the aquatic Nameless who had taken over the ruins of our old home.

I thought very highly of my own investigations into Void magic. I thought that truly no one else was taking the same kind of risks, pushing the boundaries of a mage's capabilities as much as I was.

For the other, in spite of my prodigious talents, I do admit I viewed the council with the wide eyes of a child. The idea that one of the mages I had admired could, in her mindless pursuit of power, nearly kill my own sister, struck me deep to the core.

To fail to see when you yourself have become the institution against which progress must battle. Maybe, through my graceless death and unhappy return, I am the only one who has been spared this inevitable descent into stagnancy. My very soul has changed, and changed again. I cannot very well ignore the potential to change once more.",Legacy of Gravehold (Azer)

Even before the Fall she scoffed at my irregular magic. She was afraid I would be poisoned by the teachings of Yan Magda, and I suppose, in a way I was. I learned what I was truly capable of. The version of me Brama was too afraid to nurture. newline Since then, Brama's paranoia has only grown worse. When Xaxos vanished into the Void, I celebrated alongside my people. When Brama exiled Arachnos and Karak for staging a rebellion against her, I believed again that it was for the best. When she forbade Mist from Voidwalking, I thought it was a necessary precaution. When Garu was exiled for trying to open a Void portal, I assumed that there was nothing else that could be done. And so finally, when Brama came to the home of my teacher to sentence her to an isolated life in the wilds, I merely sat and watched it happen. newline Everyone is gone, and I am still here, because deep down I am a coward. Too afraid of losing my home that I have lost all my comrades. Too desperate to fit in to accept that without Void magic, I would still be that same powerless child Brama refused all those years ago. I was afraid then. I cannot be afraid now.",Legacy of Gravehold (Azer)

When she came to me after doling out the fates of so many others who spoke out against her traditions in favor of experimentation with Void magic, the only thing I could think to say was why has it taken so long? I knew it would come. I'd been keeping my bags ready by the door for months. And compared to the Black Mausoleum, my little cottage in the wilds is a paradise. newline You see, at her core Brama is nothing but a coward. That is why she has made such a good leader all these years. After all, Gravehold was a city of cowards, who hid underground and trembled behind their walls. Even now that they have emerged from the ruins of their city, still they cower behind their safe and familiar lifestyles. The people do not want me to live among them. They do not want the discomfort of having to acknowledge that the Void exists. It is an inescapable part of their world, but they would rather treat it as the monster beneath their beds. A shadow that belongs outside the walls. I am a part of that shadow, so they put me outside and pretend I no longer exist. newline Just like the Fall, these wild Void portals are somewhat of a blessing in disguise. It's time for this city to wake up and realize that nowhere is truly safe.",Legacy of Gravehold (Azer)

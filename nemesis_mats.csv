For aeons, The Nameless would lay siege to the city, bringing us ever closer to extinction. But their cruelest stroke was in erasing our very history.#The Prince of Gluttons was the fourth of their kind to besiege the city. Even at the time, it seemed too easy to repel his attack and send The Prince lumbering back into the bright nothing of the breach. But soon those that survived the attack had forgotten the name of The World That Was. Wives stared into the empty eyes of their husbands and children with no memory of their love for one another. The old ways were lost, the words of The First Tribe mere symbols scratched upon scrolls, all of it devoured, obliterated from eternity. The Prince feeds on our very histories, leaving behind only our fear and doubt.

The first trogg has no effect.#- When a trogg is discarded, ;In the ancient time, before our kind, the troggs walked The World That Was. From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.#The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, muc the way worlds are suppposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.#Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats. And who are we but immigrants here in Gravehold, in this world they made for us? Are we not their children in some measure? Is it not their right to take it all away?;;The Depths;46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,59,63

With a quick and deliberate hand, the great city of Karek was turned to a mountain of green glass, its many thousands of denizens entombed within. The harbor towns of M'hlark were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged, frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes.#The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then. Of those that knelt before it, none were spared. And thus the Blight Lord was given its name, for the certain ruin of our people followed it like some merciless plague.;[1]#[2]#[3]: Gravehold suffers 7 damage.#[4]#[5]: The player with the lowest life suffers 4 damage.#[6]#[7]: Blight Lord gains 10 life.#[8]#[9]: The players lose.;The Nameless;39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48

A merchant in the dirt market made the mistake of brushing the wisps of its floating form as she threw up her hands in horror. She began to fade away as soon as the dust of the thing sifted between her fingers. And then it too was gone.#Like us, it is lost.

This insectoid Nameless towered over breach mages and Gravehold alike. It attacked with swarms of husks, seeking always to overwhelm its foes. The mages managed to destroy the Queen, buying time for the people of Gravehold to flee. However, in their haste to keep moving, the mages were not as thorough as usual. One of its creatures, a Broodwomb, survived that final battle. It tunneled its way to the surface, eating carrion and regaining its strength. It was in no shape to fight back when Arachnos and his followers found it, giving them the rare opportunity to capture and study a live creature from the Void. Arachnos tested his rituals on it, slowly feeding it energy from his breaches like a nursing babe. He catalogued its growth, watched it grow larger and more powerful. Arachnos' experiments may be considered immoral by the people of New Gravehold, but his notes on the growth of Maggoth could provide deep insights into the nature of Voidborn creatures. After all, Arachnos is the only human in history with the dubious honor of creating a Nameless.;Nest Mat##The players lose the game.#[ ] [ ]#Gravehold suffers 5 damage.#[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]#Gravehold suffers 2 damage.

When the Council of Elders condemned his work and forced him to stop, he grew angry. He organized a group of like-minded individuals and led them in rebellion against New Gravehold. Outnumbered and overpowered, they were eventually banished from the safe harbor of the city they had scorned. Exile did not hinder his thirst for knowledge, however, as he and his followers continued working on Xaxos's experiments, even improving upon the original designs. Arachnos was consumed by the belief that the power of the Nameless could be harnessed to protect humanity, a belief which drove him to cut corners in his research and rush towards a dangerous and poorly tested ritual. The corrupted results of these rituals still haunt the woods. Citizens of New Gravehold consider Arachnos dealt with, reduced to a simple life in the wilds.

When the Void energy flowed into him, however, instead of making him stronger it began to waste away at his life. Arachnos heard the screaming, but refused to stop the ritual. He believed in his calculations above all else, assured of his own undeniable talent. The more Karak absorbed, the more he aged until nothing but bones were left. But the ritual did not stop with his death. He warped beyond that, becoming strange and monstrous, decaying and growing all at once. When the ritual finally concluded, Karak was gone, replaced by a creature that could only be described as a Nameless. Arachnos and the other followers were forced to flee from the monster they had created. Now the Ageless Walker seems to have no memory of being humans.

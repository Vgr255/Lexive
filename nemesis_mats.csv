From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.#The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, muc the way worlds are suppposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.#Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats.

The harbor towns of M'hlark were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged, frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes.#The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then.

The monsters came down into the tunnels to chase them, but the people felt safe and secure behind their walls. They trained scouts to go out into the tunnels to keep an eye out for monsters, and they trained mages to go out in groups and beat them back before anyone got hurt. They even sent mages into the Void itself, to push the Nameless away from the city so that all the people could live safe, happy, monster-free lives. But then, the discontent began to rumble. Everyone in the city had so much time on their hands they began to try new things. Some of them tried to go back to the surface. Some of them wanted to use the power of the Void.

That's a trick you pick up after spending long enough in the Void-- the ability to sense magic. Perhaps that is what draws the weaker followers to circle around a Nameless like flies. Or like piranhas. It was certainly that aura of magical energy that drew the gigantic creature I've named Bone closer and closer into it until the trap sprung and the chains wrapped around it, draining the beast's magic for itself. Together, they are an even more deadly pair than they were apart. The beast is raw strength and the mask provides control.

She thinks what will protect this city is to cast out the dissidents, but she fails to see that those who are different outnumber those who are not. It is impossible to live in this world without becoming touched by the Void. The Void is present in everything we do. It is the mirror of our magic, it is the birthplace of the Nameless, it is the very sour of our world's power. Brama can only see the danger of it, the pain it has caused, and not the glorious potential that we have already unlocked. Our enemies may come from the Void, but so do some of our strongest protectors. To cast them aside would not only be foolish, it would be the height of cruelty.

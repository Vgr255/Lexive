First our world was taken, forcing the few that then survived into the black cold of the earth. For aeons, generations of survivors eked out meager lives in Gravehold, the breach mages all the while honing their fell craft. For aeons, The Nameless would lay siege to the city, bringing us ever closer to extinction. But their cruelest stroke was in erasing our very history.#The Prince of Gluttons was the fourth of their kind to besiege the city. Even at the time, it seemed too easy to repel his attack and send The Prince lumbering back into the bright nothing of the breach. But soon those that survived the attack had forgotten the name of The World That Was. Wives stared into the empty eyes of their husbands and children with no memory of their love for one another. The old ways were lost, the words of The First Tribe mere symbols scratched upon scrolls, all of it devoured, obliterated from eternity. The Prince feeds on our very histories, leaving behind only our fear and doubt.

The first trogg has no effect.#- When a trogg is discarded, place it in the trogg discard pile. (This is not the same as the nemesis discard pile).;In the ancient time, before our kind, the troggs walked The World That Was. From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.#The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, muc the way worlds are suppposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.#Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats. And who are we but immigrants here in Gravehold, in this world they made for us? Are we not their children in some measure? Is it not their right to take it all away?;;The Depths;46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,59,63

If there is only one, advance the Tainted Track once. If there are zero, advance the Tainted Track twice.#- When the Tainted Track is advanced to a space with an effect listed on it, resolve that effect immediately.;The Blight Lord was the first of The Nameless to touch The World That Was. With a quick and deliberate hand, the great city of Karek was turned to a mountain of green glass, its many thousands of denizens entombed within. The harbor towns of M'hlark were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged, frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes.#The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then. Of those that knelt before it, none were spared. And thus the Blight Lord was given its name, for the certain ruin of our people followed it like some merciless plague.;[1]#[2]#[3]: Gravehold suffers 7 damage.#[4]#[5]: The player with the lowest life suffers 4 damage.#[6]#[7]: Blight Lord gains 10 life.#[8]#[9]: The players lose.;The Nameless;39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48

If a spell is prepped in at least one aligned breach, then that spell is aligned. All spells are aligned to minions that are not aligned.#- Misaligned: Any spell that isn't aligned is misaligned. Misaligned spells deal half of their damage, rounded up, to the nemesis or minion to which it is misaligned.;This creature is an oddity, even amongst its odd kind, trapped in a place neither here nor there. The scouts first saw it from the west wall, flickering against the vault of the cave. They say it wailed as it fluttred through the city's defenses like a broken ghost. A merchant in the dirt market made the mistake of brushing the wisps of its floating form as she threw up her hands in horror. She began to fade away as soon as the dust of the thing sifted between her fingers. And then it too was gone.#Like us, it is lost. Of all the Nameless that have plagued us here in our last sanctum, the Wayward One alone seems almost tormented by the task.

This insectoid Nameless towered over breach mages and Gravehold alike. It attacked with swarms of husks, seeking always to overwhelm its foes. The mages managed to destroy the Queen, buying time for the people of Gravehold to flee. However, in their haste to keep moving, the mages were not as thorough as usual. One of its creatures, a Broodwomb, survived that final battle. It tunneled its way to the surface, eating carrion and regaining its strength. It was in no shape to fight back when Arachnos and his followers found it, giving them the rare opportunity to capture and study a live creature from the Void. Arachnos tested his rituals on it, slowly feeding it energy from his breaches like a nursing babe. He catalogued its growth, watched it grow larger and more powerful. Arachnos' experiments may be considered immoral by the people of New Gravehold, but his notes on the growth of Maggoth could provide deep insights into the nature of Voidborn creatures.

He was deeply devoted to Xaxos's ideals and tried to replicate his experiments, claiming that the adverse side effects could be allayed if he just did more research. When the Council of Elders condemned his work and forced him to stop, he grew angry. He organized a group of like-minded individuals and led them in rebellion against New Gravehold. Outnumbered and overpowered, they were eventually banished from the safe harbor of the city they had scorned. Exile did not hinder his thirst for knowledge, however, as he and his followers continued working on Xaxos's experiments, even improving upon the original designs. Arachnos was consumed by the belief that the power of the Nameless could be harnessed to protect humanity, a belief which drove him to cut corners in his research and rush towards a dangerous and poorly tested ritual. The corrupted results of these rituals still haunt the woods. Citizens of New Gravehold consider Arachnos dealt with, reduced to a simple life in the wilds.

The followers of Xaxos play with powers beyond anyone's comprehension. The Ageless Walker was once a man named Karak, a devoted follower of Xaxos. He was a close friend of Arachnos, and submitted willingly to the ritual. He wanted to be infused with the strength of the Nameless, to gain their power. When the Void energy flowed into him, however, instead of making him stronger it began to waste away at his life. Arachnos heard the screaming, but refused to stop the ritual. He believed in his calculations above all else, assured of his own undeniable talent. The more Karak absorbed, the more he aged until nothing but bones were left. But the ritual did not stop with his death. He warped beyond that, becoming strange and monstrous, decaying and growing all at once. When the ritual finally concluded, Karak was gone, replaced by a creature that could only be described as a Nameless. Arachnos and the other followers were forced to flee from the monster they had created. Now the Ageless Walker seems to have no memory of being humans. It kills indiscriminately, bringing death and decay wherever it walks.;;The New Age;3a10,3a11,3a12,3a13,3a14,3a15,3a16,3a17,3a18,3a6

I wonder what will become of it... but one project at a time. The runes have been adjusted to support the amount of energy the ritual consumes, and Karak has managed to capture a wolf alive to use as my next subject. A larger, stronger animal no doubt is a better candidate to survive the Void essence I must feed it. If my hypotheses are correct, the creature will adapt and grow with the Void energy, mutating into a form that can properly contain it. I must confess, I am excited.

Gravehold keeps extensive records of every Nameless we've fought before, so that we may learn from our past battles. Many were unfortunately lost in The Fall, but we managed to save some. When our scouts first brought back reports of this creature, I thought it sounded familiar, but I have faced so many Nameless that now my memory blurs with age and exhaustion.

I stood on the front lines and fought side by side with my fellow mages as the hordes of skeletal beasts descended. I was still young then. I remember thinking it was the most horrible sight I could imagine. That nothing could ever be worse than this. Now, in my old age, I fear I may have become numb to the barrage of cruelties this world slings at us. But seeing this follower of the Knight leading an army of its own evokes a new form of dread. Are the enemies we defeat never truly gone? Is it only a matter of time and experience before the hordes of minions there Nameless control become Nameless themselves? And if this is the strength a mere thrall of the Knight of Shackles controls after all these years in the Void, how powerful must the Knight itself be?"" - Z'hana";;Outcasts;3a2,3a3,3a9,3a15,3a16,3a17,3a18,3a19,3a20,3a21,3a22,3a23

The aether, shimmering within its water, drew me close. I'll admit, my curiosity outweighed my sense. Everything in the Void is made of Void essence, just as everything in our world is composed entirely of aether, so seeing this gigangtic reserve of aether here in this place was startling, to say the least. By the time I realized it was not merely a pool but a living creature, it was almost too late to escape. I spent some time observing it from afar, doing what experiments I could safely. I had hypotheses... but it wasn't until I saw a new wave of aether come through a breach and be subsumed within the waters that I realized what was truly happening. That was when I forced myself to acknowledge that the bubbles of aether floating suspended within the creature were almost recognizable, I just hadn't wanted to allow myself to recognize them. I knew then what I had to do, but I could not accomplish it alone."" - Xaxos";Fountain of Souls Track##4p Spawn    1p/2p Spawn#    |  3p Spawn   |#    |      |      |#   [ ] -> [ ] -> [ ] -> [ ] -> [ ]#                         ^      |#  When a soul moves Â¯\   |      V#  here, Gravehold    |- [ ] <- [ ]#  suffers 1 damage  _/##Lantern Charge Track##       [3]#       [2]#       [1]#       [0];Outcasts;42,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421

I could sense the vibration in the rocks. It was part of living down here. Being careful. Watching your step. Ground that looks like solid stone could turn to quicksand beneath your feet. A tunnel that's solid one day could collapse the next. I only once got a glimpse of what was doing it. Big, monster of a thing, claws as tall as me. I've always fancied myself pretty in tune with the caves, but this Nameless was beyond anything I'd ever imagined. It glided through rock like it was swimming, ripping solid stone like paper. I shudder to consider coming face to face with that monstrosity. It's dangerous enough navigating around the pitfalls it leaves in its wake."" - Cairna";;Return to Gravehold;29,47,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73

What I was no expecting to find was a giant aquatic Nameless that had taken up residence in what used to be our fair city! From above, it looked like simply the wreckage of Gravehold, piled at the bottom of the chasm, but when we began our approach, the rubble itself rose from the ground and towered above us. It's truly fascinating! The creature seems to have adapted itself quite neatly to the ruins, using the stones from our collapsed homes to create a nearly impenetrable shell. Once we defeat it, it could provide invaluable insight into the way Nameless integrate themselves into the environments of our works."" - Gygar";Fortress Track##Top Section##While the Fortress token is on this#section of the track, when a player#deals damage to it, that player#deals 1 additional damage.##                4p Start Space#  (When the last rubble token is discarded,#   move the Fortress token here)#                      |#[ ] <- [ ] <- [ ] <- [ ]# |# |  When the Fortress token moves from# |  the top section to the bottom section,# |  Fortress gains 3 rubble tokens# |# .# .# .##Bottom Section##While the Fortress token is on this#section of the track, when Fortress#would be dealt damage, reduce that#damage by 3, to a minimum of 0.#Then, discard 1 rubble token.## .# .# .# |# | - 3p Start Space# |# |   1p/2p Start# |    Space# V      |#[ ] -> [ ] -> [ ]# ^             |# |             V#[ ] <- [ ] <- [ ]# |# |#Gravehold suffers 8 damage;Return to Gravehold;74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83

We live by strict rules, our sigils minimize the number of breaches we need to have open, and we use little to no magic in order to not attract the attention of dangerous roving Portalborn. But that city does not understand how to live as we do. They clear large tracts of land for their farms, send out hunting parties, build distant outposts, and spread themselves carelessly across the surface. It is disrupting the natural patterns of the Portalborn. Their patrols and their walls drive them further south, into our forests, for sustenance. I know it was only a matter of time before something dangerous found our little village, but I had not thought to fear it would be quite this horrific. This creature walks like a man, but it is composed entirely of flame. Wherever it walks, the forest burns around it. These woods are our home, and the inferno this Portalborn leaves in its wake is almost as dangerous as the monster itself. If we cannot stop it, it could mean the end of everything."" - Kel";The Burning Kor Movement Mat##Numbers represent the ignition points##[1] > [ ] > [ ] > [ ] > [ ]   [2]#                         V     V#[ ] > [ ] > [ ] > [ ]   [ ]   [ ]# ^           ______V     V     V#[ ]   [ ] > | Grave |   [ ]   [ ]# ^     ^    | hold  |    V     V#[ ]   [ ]   |_______| < [ ]   [ ]# ^     ^     ^                 V#[ ]   [ ]   [ ] < [ ] < [ ] < [ ]# ^     ^#[4]   [ ] < [ ] < [ ] < [ ] < [3];Southern Village;63,65,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76

Only when the Queen retreats through the void do they relent, left to twitch and expire on the cave floor among the bodies of those they have overcome.

If this is true, then the Crooked Mask's domain is that of corruption, for the weapon he wields is brought by temptation.#How do we slay a god, especially one with such a dark influence over the weaker survivors among us? When we have endured on so little for so long, how do we hold back when what we need most seems to be offered so freely?#Many in Gravehold murmur that behind its grim visage lies a cruel and desolate grin.

First our world was taken, forcing the few that then survived into the black cold of the earth. For aeons, generations of survivors eked out meager lives in Gravehold, the breach mages all the while honing their fell craft. For aeons, The Nameless would lay siege to the city, bringing us ever closer to extinction. But their cruelest stroke was in erasing our very history.#The Prince of Gluttons was the fourth of their kind to besiege the city. Even at the time, it seemed too easy to repel his attack and send The Prince lumbering back into the bright nothing of the breach. But soon those that survived the attack had forgotten the name of The World That Was. Wives stared into the empty eyes of their husbands and children with no memory of their love for one another. The old ways were lost, the words of The First Tribe mere symbols scratched upon scrolls, all of it devoured, obliterated from eternity. The Prince feeds on our very histories, leaving behind only our fear and doubt. We are a people with no past nor future, trapped only in the fleeting moments before our eyes.;;Aeon's End;255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263

With each generation, the joy in their faces and voices diminishes, every instinct sharpened to a single word: survive.#Malastar believes The Nameless waited for us to become worthy foes before sending their champion, the one we call ""Rageborne"". It is their executioner; here to quicken Gravehold's end. Never have I seen such anger, all of it reflected into the dead eyes of the rabid beasts it commands.#When the breaches open, the beggars in Chasmwalk shout above the city bells: ""The end is near!

The first trogg has no effect.#- When a trogg is discarded, place it in the trogg discard pile. (This is not the same as the nemesis discard pile.);In the ancient time, before our kind, the troggs walked The World That Was. From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.#The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, muc the way worlds are suppposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.#Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats. And who are we but immigrants here in Gravehold, in this world they made for us? Are we not their children in some measure? Is it not their right to take it all away?;;The Depths;46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,59,63

If there is only one, advance the Tainted Track once. If there are zero, advance the Tainted Track twice.#- When the Tainted Track is advanced to a space with an effect listed on it, resolve that effect immediately.;The Blight Lord was the first of The Nameless to touch The World That Was. With a quick and deliberate hand, the great city of Karek was turned to a mountain of green glass, its many thousands of denizens entombed within. The harbor towns of M'hlark were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged, frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes.#The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then. Of those that knelt before it, none were spared. And thus the Blight Lord was given its name, for the certain ruin of our people followed it like some merciless plague.;[1]#[2]#[3]: Gravehold suffers 7 damage.#[4]#[5]: The player with the lowest life suffers 4 damage.#[6]#[7]: Blight Lord gains 10 life.#[8]#[9]: The players lose.;The Nameless;39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48

If a spell is prepped in at least one aligned breach, then that spell is aligned.#- Misaligned: Any prepped spell that isn't aligned is misaligned. Misaligned spells deal half of their damage, rounded up, to the nemesis or minion to which it is misaligned.;This creature is an oddity, even amongst its odd kind, trapped in a place neither here nor there. The scouts first saw it from the west wall, flickering against the vault of the cave. They say it wailed as it fluttred through the city's defenses like a broken ghost. A merchant in the dirt market made the mistake of brushing the wisps of its floating form as she threw up her hands in horror. She began to fade away as soon as the dust of the thing sifted between her fingers. And then it too was gone.#Like us, it is lost. Of all the Nameless that have plagued us here in our last sanctum, the Wayward One alone seems almost tormented by the task. The breach mages say they show compassion toward the wretched thing by fighting against it with all their might, for like us, it is seeking an end to its struggle.;Position Chart:##--> [ I ]#|     |#|     V#|   [II ]#|     |#|     V#|   [III]#|     |#|     V#--- [IV ];The Nameless;56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64

After that, it was decided the scouts would keep a safe distance, watching the Fungal Mesh from afar.#The Fungal Mesh is more powerful than Brama estimated, and now she has fallen under the spell of the beast. It must be stopped if we are to have any hope of a new life on the surface.;;Legacy;IV2,IV3,IV4,END80,IV6,IV7,IV7,IV8,IV9,IV10

The player whose name is on that Crystal suffers 2 damage.#- If no sticker was able to be placed in this way, any player suffers 2 damage.#- Haze Fiend loses two nemesis tokens.#- Repeat this until Haze Fiend has one or less nemesis tokens.##Flawed Crystals will remain flawed throughout the remaining games of Aeon's End: Legacy. When playing a Legacy character outside of this campaign, use non-flawed Crystals.#Players must use the flawed or non-flawed Crystals bearing their names to build their starting deck and hand in all subsequent games of Aeon's End: Legacy.#Do not add flawed stickers if there are none left.#Do not replay this Chapter if you lose the game.;At first, we didn't know what the Haze Fiend was. Reports had come in of a mysterious fog enveloping our camps, appearing and vanishing within an hour, leaving several dead and wounded behind. We had no idea that it was a Nameless, and that the fog was its natural camouflage.#If not stopped, Haze Fiend will travel from camp to camp, extinguish all life, until it reaches New Gravehold. We will do what we can to prepare, but we cannot always be vigilant. I fear it will come when we are eating or sleeping.;;Legacy;V2,V3,V4,END81,V6,V7,V8,V9,V10
Deathmind;80;6;4;;Remove one power token from Sever Link.;Arrange the supply in a three by three grid. Place the piles so that the gems start the top row, then relics, and finally spells. Within each card type, arrange the piles by cost, from least expensive to most expensive.#Read the additional rules for information about Bridge tokens. Then, choose six spaces orthogonally between supply piles, and place a Bridge token in each of those six spaces. Place them so that each token is between only two piles, and there is at most one token between each piles.#Place Sever Link into play with three power tokens.;;;Players may spend 6$ or lose 5 pulse tokens to establish a neural bridge instead of 5$ or 4 pulse tokens.;- Players cannot gain the last card in a supply pile.#- During any player's main phase, that player may spend 5$ or lose 4 pulse tokens to establish a neural bridge with Brama and place a Bridge token in between any two orthogonally adjacent supply piles.#- Bridge tokens cannot be placed between two supply piles which already have a Bridge token.#- Supply piles with Bridge tokens between them are connected. Two supply piles are connected if a path can be traced from one supply pile to the other via Bridge tokens.#- When a player gains a card from a supply pile not connected to the first supply pile in the top row, that player suffers 2 damage.;Every scout and mage who have attempted to confront Deathmind have returned with their minds mostly wiped, their memories, reflexes, and natural abilities taken from them. Some were able to recover, after weeks spent away from Deathmind's influence, while others will never be the same.#Confronting Deathmind is a desperate measure, but these are desperate times. If Brama's plan works, perhaps we will have a chance to defeat it after all.;;Legacy;VI2,END82,VI4,VI5,VI6,VI7,END83,VI9,VI10,VI11

Then, Maelstrom: Risen takes a turn as normal. The Assault turn order card is considered a nemesis turn order card.#- When a beacon is discarded, place it in the beacon discard pile next to the beacon deck. (This is not the same as the nemesis discard pile.)#- When the beacon deck is empty and a card would be drawn from it, shuffle the beacon discard pile and place it facedown to form the beacon deck.#- When there are ten beacons in play, Maelstrom: Risen opens a massive, destructive breach and the players lose.;We should have known better than to consider Maelstrom defeated. In our hubris, we left our old lives behind, and considered Maelstrom buried along with them. Yet it was siphoning power the entire time we've been on the surface, slowly gathering strength to take revenge.#And now, the time for its revenge has come. It looms over New Gravehold, and I fear there is little we can do to stop it. In our first battle against Maelstrom, we only managed to survive through Dezmodia's sacrifice. This time around, we cannot afford to lose another. Our newest breach mages need to be stronger than any before. They must triumph.;;Legacy;VII3,VII5,VII7,VII9,VII11,VII13,VII14,VII15,VII16,END84,VII18,VII19,VII20,VII21

Resolve the rest of the on exhaust effects.;It seems that Xaxos's lust for power has finally overtaken him. The mage we used to call friend and ally has turned his back on New Gravehold, obsessed only with the power of the Nameless and their breaches. It is never easy to step into battle against a former friend, but if Xaxos is not stopped now, I fear that he will become too powerful to ever overcome.#His power has been amplified by his time in the void, and he can use breaches in a way no living mage has ever done.;Breach mat#All breaches are opened##[Breach I]  [Breach II]  [Breach III]  [Breach IV]#                         Any player    Gravehold #                         suffers 2     suffers 2#                         damage when   damage when#                         a spell is    a spell is#                         cast from     cast from#                         this breach.  this breach.;Legacy;VIII25,VIII27,VIII29,VIII30,VIII31,VIII32,VIII33,VIII34,VIII35,VIII36,VIII37,VIII38,VIII39,VIII40,VIII41,END85,VIII43,VIII44,VIII45

This insectoid Nameless towered over breach mages and Gravehold alike. It attacked with swarms of husks, seeking always to overwhelm its foes. The mages managed to destroy the Queen, buying time for the people of Gravehold to flee. However, in their haste to keep moving, the mages were not as thorough as usual. One of its creatures, a Broodwomb, survived that final battle. It tunneled its way to the surface, eating carrion and regaining its strength. It was in no shape to fight back when Arachnos and his followers found it, giving them the rare opportunity to capture and study a live creature from the Void. Arachnos tested his rituals on it, slowly feeding it energy from his breaches like a nursing babe. He catalogued its growth, watched it grow larger and more powerful. Arachnos' experiments may be considered immoral by the people of New Gravehold, but his notes on the growth of Maggoth could provide deep insights into the nature of Voidborn creatures. After all, Arachnos is the only human in history with the dubious honor of creating a Nameless.;Nest Mat##The players lose the game.#[ ] [ ]#Gravehold suffers 5 damage.#[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]#Gravehold suffers 2 damage.

When we disrupted his ritual and defeated the spider-like Nameless he'd fused himself with, we recovered the scattered remains of his journal. From the notes we could piece together, it looks like this poor creature used to be a simple rabbit before Arachnos accidentally abandoned it inside the Void. Now look what it has become. If this is what a few months of exposure to the Void essence can do to an animal, it's no wonder Xaxos and his ilk believe the Void is supremely powerful. But all I have seen it do is twist, corrupt, and blacken. Can such a force ever truly be used for good? That remains to be seen.

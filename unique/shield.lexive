Shield tokens are used with certain minions from Legacy, starting in deck III and later, as well as some minions from the Buried Secrets expansion. The number of shield tokens a minion starts with is indicated by a number on the left of the card. When a minion with at least one shield token is dealt any amount of damage, remove a single shield token from the minion, instead of removing any life tokens. Remove only one shield token each time an instance of damage is dealt to the minion, regardless of the amount of damage that would otherwise be dealt. Lost shield tokens are not regained, unless an effect explicitly specifies it.

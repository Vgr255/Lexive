When you use the Conjure effect of a card, you look at the top card of your deck, then you may prep it facedown to one of your opened breaches or a closed breach that was focused this turn. Facedown cards prepped to breaches are considered spells that cost 2 aether and have the text "Cast: Deal 2 damage." When you cast one of these cards, place it faceup in your discard pile. You may look at facedown cards prepped to your breaches at any time.
